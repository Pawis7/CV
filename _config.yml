  My Name is Saul, I am a Studient of Computing Science at the "Universidad De Guadlajara" (UDeG)

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Hosting Minecraft Servers</mark> and <mark>Expert Learning on whatever i want to learn</mark>

  I really like to learn new things, to be updated all the time and try to understand everything, another thing that appeals to me is to reverse engineer things, otherwise, learn how everything works, learn from that and see if there is something better to do.

          I made this game for my hypermedia class, I learned a little bit of C# and a lot of unity, both physics and aesthetic details, for advantage I had knowledge of video game editors, the truth is that I didn't like it at all but it's done.

          I felt that half of the career I did not learn anything since it uses half of the career to teach fundamentals and use it as a filter, however in my 5th semester I learned a lot of skills, how data mining works, how to host servers in dockers, github and above all, python.

          
          I owe my great progress to my teacher <mark>Carlos Alberto Guzman Montes</mark>, who gave me many tools of which I took the most interesting and I plan to take more in the future for my training.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in networks and software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Play video games like minecraft, goemetry dash, and more.
      - I want to go deeper into Geometry Dash, since I create levels here and this helps my imagination a lot.
      - Do Gym.
      - I like to learn new things, I am currently learning how to almost all by my own.
